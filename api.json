      "full": "Gettysburg Battlefield, site of the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War, has been considered one of the most haunted locations in the United States for over 160 years. The three-day battle in July 1863 resulted in approximately 51,000 casualties, making it the war's deadliest engagement. The unprecedented scale of death and suffering has led to centuries of reported paranormal activity, with thousands of witnesses documenting encounters with apparitions, phantom sounds, unexplained phenomena, and residual hauntings across the 6,000-acre battlefield and surrounding town. The Gettysburg hauntings encompass a wide range of paranormal phenomena reported by soldiers immediately after the battle, residents, tourists, historians, park rangers, and paranormal investigators. From Civil War soldiers' accounts of ghostly encounters to modern-day photographs capturing unexplained figures, Gettysburg represents one of the most extensively documented haunted locations in American history. The battlefield has become a focal point for paranormal research, historical preservation, and the study of how mass trauma and death may influence locations for generations."
